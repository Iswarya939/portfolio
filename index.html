                <p>In this training, I learned how to build modern websites using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I focused on making websites "responsive," which means they look great on both mobile phones and laptops. I also learned how to write neat and organized code so that the websites load fast and are easy for others to understand.</p>

                    <h4>1. Abstract (Project Overview)</h4>
                    <p>The "Home Therapy" project addresses the critical challenge of accessing musculoskeletal (MSK) care. Many individuals suffering from chronic pain due to arthritis or injuries face barriers like high costs, travel distance, and mobility issues. Our digital platform, inspired by Hinge Health, bridges this gap by delivering evidence-based physical therapy through smartphones and computers. It empowers users to manage their recovery from home using a combination of guided exercises, wearable sensors, and virtual coaching, ultimately improving their quality of life.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="report-section">
                    <h4>2. Industrial Vertical & Domain Technology</h4>
                    <p>This project sits at the intersection of Healthcare and Artificial Intelligence. We leverage AI to create dynamic, personalized therapy plans that adapt to each user's pain level and recovery speed. By integrating motion-tracking technology and wearable sensors, the platform provides real-time biomechanical feedback. This ensures that users perform exercises with the correct form, maximizing treatment efficacy while minimizing the risk of further injury.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="report-section">
                    <h4>3. Empathy (User-Centric Approach)</h4>
                    <p>At its heart, this project is built on deep empathy for those living with daily physical exhaustion and emotional stress caused by chronic pain. We recognize that users are often balancing work and family while struggling with discomfort. Our "Empathy Map" identifies that users need expert guidance that is not time-consuming or complicated. We aim to communicate a supportive message: "We are here to help you heal on your schedule," removing the helplessness felt when clinical access is limited.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="report-section">
                    <h4>4. Define (Problem & Solution)</h4>
                    <p>Musculoskeletal conditions are a leading cause of disability worldwide. Traditional in-person therapy is effective but often inaccessible for rural or uninsured populations. We define our solution as a "Digital MSK Clinic" that provides high-quality video demonstrations, educational content, and a dedicated remote care team (therapists and health coaches). This model reduces barriers to entry and empowers individuals to take control of their physical function without relying solely on invasive surgery or medication.</p>

                <div class="report-section">
                    <h4>5. Ideate (Core Innovation)</h4>
                    <p>During the ideation phase, we focused on making the platform scalable and intelligent. Key features include Cross-Platform Compatibility (working on iOS, Android, and Desktop) and Offline Support for low-data environments. We also conceptualized "Intelligent Motion Tracking," where the smartphone camera acts as a digital eye to monitor body posture. This phase also prioritized secure data handling, ensuring that all patient information is protected under healthcare privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR.</p>

                <div class="report-section">
                    <h4>6. Prototype & Working Mechanism</h4>
                    <p>The project functions through a seamless digital loop: it begins with a comprehensive digital assessment of the user's symptoms and mobility. An AI engine then generates a tailored exercise plan. As the user performs the movements, real-time feedback is provided via motion sensors. All progress data is logged and reviewed by a remote team of licensed professionals who adjust the therapy plan as needed. This continuous integration of smart technology and human expertise ensures a safe and effective recovery journey.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="report-section">
                    <h4>7. Testing, Deployment & Future Enhancements</h4>
                    <p>The platform underwent rigorous Unit Testing for individual modules like AI algorithms and Integration Testing to ensure smooth data flow between the frontend and backend. Post-deployment, our future roadmap includes the integration of Virtual Reality (VR) for immersive exercise environments and Blockchain for ultra-secure medical data storage. We also plan to incorporate mental wellness support and gamified recovery tasks to address the emotional challenges of long-term rehabilitation.</p>
